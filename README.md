    - !Disclaimer i haven't tested using the same account for both. This is designed to use seperate accounts!
  - Make sure the toggle next to **Save** is on (enabled)
  - Then click save! 

  - No restart should be required. You'll see the Twtch logo and **"3 stacked diamonds"** at the bottom left turn green. These are status indicators!

  - Here you'll see a toggle called Show secrets click it and copy the JWT Token 
    Paste it into KevBot, **Accounts > StreamElements Twitch Settings** click save and enable it.

  - Only tests are working for StreamElements Youtube (**WIP**)

- **StreamElements (Youtube)**
  - Go to: **[StreamElements Dashboard](https://streamelements.com/dashboard/account/channels)**

# Modules

Here is a general list of modules you can use to make commands or trigger on events:

- **Text Module (Twitch chat only for now)**  
    - This will send a reply back to yout chat.
    - Can use **Replacers** to make the text more flexible.
-  **Audio Player Module**  
    - Play MP3s and set a volume/Speed.
    - Can also wait for the audio to finish before continue to the nest module.
- **Dice Module**
  - "Rolls" a 2-100 sided dice.
  - **Roll Responde** allows you to send a custom response. **(Twitch chat only for now)**
  - Use the text **replacers** "$diceSides" and "$diceRoll" to see what you rolled!
- **Delay Module**
  - Just a simple delay module to add between other modules.
  - REALLY precise time control: "Milliseconds", "Seconds", "Minutes", "Hours".
- **Permissions Module** (Twitch only for now)
  - Set any combination of allowed users to trigger a command **EVEN TWITCH REWARDS!**
  - You can also set Specific users to use your commands or rewards.
  - You also have a "No Permissions Response" area to let the user know they dont have permissions.
- **TTS Module (Text to Speech)**
  - Use the same TTS you already know from StreamElements and StreamLabs!
  - Use a users input from chat, or et your own TTS reply.
- **KeyStroke Module**
  - Mimics key presses!
  - Make Ctrl. Alt, Shift combinations. (Crtl, Shift, F24)
  - Send full messages in "Send Ketstrokes" mode.
- **OBS Module**
  - Change scenes
  - Update text sources **Supports replacers**
  - Mute/Unmute inputs and outputs (Mic, Desktop, ect)
  - Control Streaming, Recording, Virtual cam, Studio mode 
  - Control source visibility (On, Off, Toggle)
  - Control scene/source filter visibility (On, Off, Toggle)
  - Control Media (Play, Pause, Restart, Stop, Next, Previous, Set Time, toggle)
  - Replay buffer (Save, Start, Stop, Toggle)
  - Change media paths
  - Mute sources
- **Randomizer Module**
  - Nest modules in **Options** to give your Commands/Events/Rewards a bit of randomness.
  - You can add infinite number of **Options!**
  - Give each **Option** a percentage change to have options trigger more or less often.
  - This module can also be nested within itself. So **Randomizers in Randomizers!**
- **Twitch Actions Module**
  - Run Announcement, Commercial, Create Clip, add Markers, Mod users and a lot MORE! üöÄ

- **MQTT Module**
  - This is more for me but still useful!
  - Publish messages to your MQTT server
