## 🚀 Once you installed the app

### Twitch setup

  - Go to **Accounts** and click the **^** on the box called **"Twitch Login"** (These are dropdowns) 
  - Login to your Twitch streamer account first then your Twitch Bot account.
    - !Disclaimer i haven't tested using the same account for both. This is designed to use seperate accounts!
  - Make sure the toggle next to **Save** is on (enabled)
  - Then click save! 

  - No restart should be required. You'll see the Twtch logo and **"3 stacked diamonds"** at the bottom left turn green. These are status indicators!

### StreamElements and Streamlabs (Lightly tested)  
Now for KevBot yout'll be using StreamElements and StreamLabs JWTTs

    Paste it into KevBot, **Accounts > StreamElements Twitch Settings** click save and enable it.
